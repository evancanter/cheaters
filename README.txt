================================================================
Cd into the directory that this file is in (where you unzipped),
and run the 'make' command. This will create an executable named
plagiarismCatcher.

Usage: 
1. Have the files you want to examine in a single directory.
2. Use ./plagiarismCatcher /path/to/files chunkSize
note: the last forward slash doesn't matter; you can either
    have it in or omit it.
3. The program will output the files with high (>200) similarity 
    in chunks in order of descending magnitude.

form: 
    number : file1, file2
    number : file2, file3
